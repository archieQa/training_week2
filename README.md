## API Installation

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

2. Create your database on Clever Cloud
   - Create a MongoDB add-on
   - Retrieve the MongoDB connection URI from the add-on information

3. Create `.env` file in `/api`:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   BREVO_KEY=your-brevo-api-key
   APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

4. Configure Sentry (optional)

   In `api/src/config.js`, add your Sentry DSN.

5. Seed the database with sample data (optional)

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

   This creates test users, admin, and sample events:
   - **Users**: john@example.com, jane@example.com, bob@example.com (password: password123)
   - **Admin**: admin@example.com (password: admin123)

6. Start the server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📧 Brevo Configuration (Emails)

For email features to work (forgot password, invitations, etc.), you need to configure Brevo:

### 1. Create a Brevo account

Go to [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) and create an account.

### 2. Get the API key

- Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
- Create a new API key
- Add it to your `.env` file: `BREVO_KEY=your-api-key`

### 3. Configure the sender

In `api/src/services/brevo.js`, update the constants:

```javascript
const SENDER_NAME = "Your App Name";
const SENDER_EMAIL = "noreply@yourdomain.com";
```

### 4. Create email templates

Create templates in Brevo (**Marketing** > **Templates** > **Create Template**):

| Template           | Usage            | Required variables      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `FORGOT_PASSWORD`  | Password reset   | `cta` (reset link)      |
| `ADMIN_INVITATION` | Admin invitation | `cta` (invitation link) |

### 5. Configure template IDs

In `api/src/utils/constants.js`, add the created template IDs:

```javascript
const BREVO_TEMPLATES = {
  FORGOT_PASSWORD: 1, // Replace with your template ID
  ADMIN_INVITATION: 2, // Replace with your template ID
};

module.exports = { BREVO_TEMPLATES };
```

### Brevo template example

For the `FORGOT_PASSWORD` template, create an email with:

- A button or link using the variable `{{ params.cta }}`
- Example: `<a href="{{ params.cta }}">Reset my password</a>`

## 🔀 Git Workflow & Pull Requests

### Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone <your-fork-url>`
3. Add the upstream remote: `git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>`

### Working on Features

Each Week 1 feature should be developed in its own branch and submitted as a **separate Pull Request**:

```bash
# Example: Building the Venue module
git checkout -b feature/venue-module
# ... make your changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add venue model, controller and frontend pages"
git push origin feature/venue-module
# Then create a PR from your fork
```

### PR Best Practices

**✅ DO:**

- **One PR per feature** - Each feature (Venue module, Google Calendar service, Cleanup script, etc.) should be a separate PR
- **Full-stack & working** - Your PR should include both backend (model + controller) and frontend (pages + API integration), fully functional
- **Small but complete** - Each PR should be focused on ONE feature, but that feature should work end-to-end
- **Self-contained** - Features are independent of each other, so you can work on them in any order
- **Clear commit messages** - Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- **Test before submitting** - Make sure your feature works locally before creating the PR

**❌ DON'T:**

- Don't submit giant PRs with multiple features
- Don't submit incomplete features (backend without frontend)
- Don't submit PRs with broken code or linter errors
- Don't mix unrelated changes in one PR

### Example PRs for Week 1

Each of these should be a **separate PR**:

1. **PR #1**: `feat: add venue model and CRUD controller`
   - Backend: Venue model, controller with CRUD operations
   - Frontend: Venue list, create, and edit pages
   - Working end-to-end

2. **PR #2**: `feat: add google calendar service integration`
   - Backend: Google Calendar service file
   - Integration with Event creation
   - Working calendar export

3. **PR #3**: `feat: add cleanup bad events script`
   - Script to remove events with "not-good" in title
   - Package.json script entry
   - Tested and working

4. **PR #4**: `feat: add calendar webhook for sync`
   - Backend: Webhook endpoint
   - Proper webhook signature verification
   - Updates event status based on calendar changes

5. **PR #5**: `feat: add event reminders cron job`
   - Cron job to send reminders 24h before event
   - Email integration
   - Tested with sample events

### PR Title Format

Use clear, descriptive titles:

- ✅ `feat: add venue module with full CRUD and frontend`
- ✅ `feat: integrate google calendar export service`
- ✅ `feat: add stripe webhook for payment updates`
- ❌ `update code`
- ❌ `fixes`
- ❌ `week 1 stuff`

### Review Process

1. Submit your PR from your fork to the original repository
2. Trainer will review and provide feedback
3. Address feedback by pushing new commits to the same branch
4. Once approved, your PR will be merged
